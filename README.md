Worlds Hardest Math Problem Solved! Polynomial Time = Nondeterministic Polynomial Time

Through usage of N=P-P/N which is a recursive function that determines that nondeterminism, I have used a starting point of other nondeterminism using my SKELETONKEY
program which implements recursion as well to simultaneously represent 1 and 0 in a series of UTF-8 which is represented as a Number
Despite being astronomically large numbers, of 8 digits of 8 places in binary, the division problem brings it down to an accuracy of .00000000003 seconds off, 
unless you change your path while this program is running then it will be as much as .2 seconds off.

Just so you can get a hint of how insane that is, a recursive division problem, using the time, with a massive nondeterministic number is still getting the correct time without the number being determined by the time.
