Worlds Hardest Math Problem Solved! Polynomial Time = Nondeterministic Polynomial Time

Through usage of N=P-P/N which is a recursive function that determines that nondeterminism, I have used a starting point of other nondeterminism using my SKELETONKEY
program which implements recursion as well to simultaneously represent 1 and 0 in a series of UTF-8 which is represented as a number
Despite being astronomically large numbers, of 8 numbers of 8 places in binary, the division problem brings it down to an accuracy of .00000000003 seconds off, 
unless you change your path while this program is running then it will be as much as .2 seconds off.

Just so you can get a hint of how insane that is, a recursive division problem, using the time, with a massive nondeterministic number is still getting the correct time without the number being determined by the time.

As an example. Say the clock was 05:56:12

(not gonna just grab the correct number because I shouldn't be able to just give you a random number and it be right)

the first run might be binary when consciously grabbed made the number 582, the next 108, the next 125. and so on and so forther until there are 8 numbers
These 8 numbers are pieced together in order, like 582108125.......

For some fucking reason, the number it comes up with is implemented in a recursive binary so that N=P-P/N

N initialization starts at 582108125....

P initiates at 55612....

so the recursion starts N = 55612 - 55612/582108125... but because the last number is N, this division and subtraction will recur until the computer decides to give up on the recursive function.

You know what N will equal at the end?

55612

or

55611.99999999999999997

What really begs to question is, how the hell is it so nondeterministic, that it can finish an infinite recursive problem instantly?
